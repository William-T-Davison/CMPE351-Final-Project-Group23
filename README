In this project, we aimed to explore and analyze the factors
influencing the pricing of Airbnb listings, focusing on three
critical aspects: the impact of the average lister rating on
price, finding the feature that is most influential on the
price of a listing, and the relationship of local house prices
in the area vs Airbnb listing prices. The input for our
problem consists of data from Airbnb listings, including, list
price, reviews per month, total number of reviews, room
type, availability, location, and minimum nights required to
book. We will also be utilizing Zillowâ€™s dataset of housing
sales to compare housing prices to rental prices. The input
from this dataset will be, price, building type, and location.
The expected outcome of our problem is a comprehensive
understanding of what factors correlate with Airbnb pricing
and what effect they have.
